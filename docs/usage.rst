Usage
================

Python interface of this project works almost the same as PyMatching.
You can compare `the PyMatching document for decoding the toric code <https://pymatching.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toric-code-example.html>`_ and `our examples <https://github.com/chaeyeunpark/UnionFind/tree/main/python_utils>`_.
